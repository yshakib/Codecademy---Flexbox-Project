    <h3>Coding my yellow brick road</h3>
    <p>
      After a decade of working in recruitment where my skillset revolved around
      influencing people to make certain decisions, I decided to change
      gears.<br />
      After learning my way around what makes people tick and how to cater to
      them in a solutions-focused manner, I longed for something more..
      <i>binary</i>. <br />
      So, here I am - a coding cadet. This greenie is learning a new skillset
      and forging a new way through the wonderful world of coding.
